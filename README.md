This is a project i made, this online library platform was pretty fun to make, it was kind of a follow along type of thing but with my own twist, theres many aspects i could've added or improved. i was going to add some type of subscription service called "library+" or "Bookworm+" the entire featured section was gonna be that but i did half of it and realized i had already put enough time into the project and how much more id need to have it functional and kinda backtracked it and labelled it featured books.  and i wanted to add some ai generated summary of all the books but yk same story as the library+ thing (time).  or even an about page but i kinda saw this as a throw away practice project, and didnt want to waste any more time

There's alot of user interaction i added as a little pizazz such as cursors that tell you you cant click an element, so im not leaving people confused and questioning their wifi or something. i also added some fun ones because... why the flip not, i should also add that this is the project i found out i could add my own cursor. no body told me this and i assume for good reason because im gonna be adding them in quite a few of my new projects to come. thanks to "badhtml.com" (forgive me if i misremembered) the site had a cool mouse and i inspected the element and kinda adopted their cursor image and took a look at the code to see how they added it (hint: url(blahblah) )

In a nut shell, great learning experience and i look forward to more projects to come and if youre an inteviewer or recruiter type of person, dont judge too harsh theres more in the works. and yk hire me or whatever (8P)->-<
